      <p>Hi, my name’s Hai. I’m currently a Senior Software Engineer at Sony PlayStation, focusing on the front-end.
After more than 5 years at PlayStation, I’m looking forward to my next journey on building software in other areas.
I have extensive experiences in working with JavaScript and different front-end frameworks, especially React and React Native.
In addition to the technical know-how, I’m also very keen on building applications that are fast and delightful.
Having worked on different teams in an agile environment along with some remote working experience, I believe I’ll be a good fit for this remote position.</p>

<p>I am skilled in: 
<mark>JavaSript</mark>
<mark>ES6</mark>
<mark>React</mark>
<mark>React Native</mark>
<mark>CSS</mark>
<mark>SASS</mark>
<mark>Redux</mark>
<mark>Apollo</mark>
<mark>GraphQL</mark>
<mark>Jest</mark>
