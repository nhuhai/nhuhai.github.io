      <p>Hi, my name’s Hai. I’m currently a Senior Software Engineer at Sony PlayStation, focusing on the front-end.
After more than 5 years at PlayStation, I’m looking forward to my next journey on building software in other areas.
I have extensive experiences in working with JavaScript and different front-end frameworks, especially React and React Native.
In addition to the technical know-how, I’m also very keen on building applications that are fast and delightful.
Having worked on different teams in an agile environment along with some remote working experience, I believe I’ll be a good fit for this remote position.</p>

<p>I am skilled in: 
<mark>JavaSript</mark>
<mark>ES6</mark>
<mark>React</mark>
<mark>React Native</mark>
<mark>CSS</mark>
<mark>SASS</mark>
<mark>Redux</mark>
<mark>GraphQL</mark>
<mark>Jest</mark>
<mark>Selenium</mark>
<mark>NodeJS</mark>
<mark>Flow</mark>
<mark>Webpack</mark>
<mark>Git</mark></p>

  <li>Throughout my different roles as a front-end developer, I always aim to deliver consumer-facing web applications at highest quality possible. I have also deeply involved in code review, architectural discussions across different teams, mentoring new team members, working closely with Product Manager, Product Owner, and designers to clarify and implement the correct specs. I’m also willing to learn new technologies and take on any challenging technical problems in order to ship successful products.</li>
  <li>As a Senior Software Engineer, I have become more involved in phase releasing new versions of our web apps, working on a couple new projects in React, React Native, redux, and react-apollo. In addition, I was responsible for major features of bigger applications that consist of dependencies from multiple teams.</li>
  <li>As a Software Engineer II, besides my engineering tasks, I also took on the Scrum Master role for the team, using my detail-oriented characteristic to help plan out our upcoming deliverables. I worked with the team on planning, developing, and shipping my.playstation.com that includes single-page apps for profile and friends.</li>
  <li>As a Software Engineer I, I became one of the founding members of the team that developed the social toolbar on playstation.com using Ember.js that includes features such as authentication, notifications, friends, profile, and real-time messaging.</li>
  <li>As a Software Engineer Intern, I worked with the team on delivering the PS Now experience on Sony and Samsung Smart TVs using Backbone.js.</li>
