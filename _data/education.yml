    I did my Master thesis in entity context searching with implementation in Solr. That's when I really learned a lot about open-source software development, having to dig through the code written by other amazing coders and get a sense about the community around it. I also worked part-time as a Software Developer for the SJSU Associated Students to revamp all of their static pages by using Python, BeautifulSoup, HTML, and CSS.
